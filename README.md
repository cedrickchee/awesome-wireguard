## What is WireGuard

> WireGuard® is an extremely simple yet fast and modern VPN that utilizes 
> state-of-the-art cryptography. It aims to be faster, simpler, leaner, and more 
> useful than IPsec, while avoiding the massive headache. It intends to be 
> considerably more performant than OpenVPN. WireGuard is designed as a general 
> purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces and super computers alike, 
> fit for many different circumstances. Initially released for the Linux kernel, 
> it is now cross-platform (Windows, macOS, BSD, iOS, Android) and widely 
> deployable. It is currently under heavy development, but already it might 
> be regarded as the most secure, easiest to use, and simplest VPN solution 
> in the industry.

## Projects

### Tools

- [wg-quick](https://git.zx2c4.com/wireguard-tools/about/src/man/wg-quick.8) - Official cross-platform tool to set up a WireGuard interface simply.
- [easy-wg-quick](https://github.com/burghardt/easy-wg-quick) - Creates Wireguard configuration for hub and peers with ease.
![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/burghardt/easy-wg-quick?style=flat-square&color=informational) :green_circle:
- [dsnet](https://github.com/naggie/dsnet/) - Simple command to manage a centralised wireguard VPN. Think wg-quick but quicker: key generation + address allocation.
![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/naggie/dsnet?style=flat-square&color=informational) :green_circle:
- [wgctrl](https://github.com/WireGuard/wgctrl-go) - Package wgctrl enables control of WireGuard interfaces on multiple platforms.
![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/WireGuard/wgctrl-go?style=flat-square&color=informational) :green_circle:
- [wgzero](https://github.com/finzzz/wgzero) - Zero overhead wireguard setup.
![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/finzzz/wgzero?style=flat-square&color=informational) :yellow_circle:
- [wg-make](https://github.com/tevino/wg-make) - A tool to help set up WireGuard based networks. Currently, it generates configurations for peers according to a single configuration file.
![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/tevino/wg-make?style=flat-square&color=informational) :red_circle:
- [onetun](https://github.com/aramperes/onetun) - A user-space WireGuard port-forwarder -- access ports running on peers in your WireGuard network from any device; without having to install WireGuard locally or without root access (no iptables configs).
![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/aramperes/onetun?style=flat-square&color=informational) :green_circle:
- [wireproxy](https://github.com/octeep/wireproxy) - A userspace WireGuard client that connects to a WireGuard peer, and exposes a SOCKS5 proxy. (Use cases: Setting up WG as a VPN requires special privilege. It tells the kernel to create a special network interface to handle WG connection. This can get messy if you do not have any special permission (i.e., root), if you do not have proper firewall configuration, or if you want to connect to multiple WG peers at once. wireproxy static tunneling is basically openssh `-D`, which supports SOCKS5 protocols.)
![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/octeep/wireproxy?style=flat-square&color=informational) :green_circle:
- [wireguard-manager-and-api](https://github.com/Mawthuq-Software/wireguard-manager-and-api) - A tool for rotating the keys on peers to increase their privacy by removing their IP address from memory.
![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/Mawthuq-Software/wireguard-manager-and-api?style=flat-square&color=informational) :yellow_circle:
- [sandialabs/wiretap](https://github.com/sandialabs/wiretap) - Wiretap is a transparent, VPN-like proxy server that tunnels traffic via WireGuard and requires no special privileges to run.
![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/sandialabs/wiretap?style=flat-square&color=informational) :green_circle:

### Mesh Network

- [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) - Tailscale is a WireGuard-based app that makes secure, private networks easy for teams of any scale.
- [Headscale](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale) - An open source implementation of the Tailscale control server.
![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/juanfont/headscale?style=flat-square&color=informational) :green_circle:
- [innernet](https://github.com/tonarino/innernet) - A private network system that uses WireGuard under the hood. It is similar in its goals to Slack's nebula or Tailscale.
![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/tonarino/innernet?style=flat-square&color=informational) :green_circle:
- [Kilo](https://github.com/squat/kilo) - Kilo is a multi-cloud network overlay built on WireGuard and designed for Kubernetes (k8s + wg = kg).
![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/squat/kilo?style=flat-square&color=informational) :green_circle:
- [NetBird](https://github.com/netbirdio/netbird) - (Previously Wiretrustee) NetBird is an open-source VPN management platform built on top of WireGuard® making it easy to create secure private networks for your organization or home. Technically, it creates an overlay network using ICE protocol (WebRTC) to negotiate P2P connections and WG (kernel module, when possible) to create a fast and encrypted tunnel between machines, falling back to relay (TURN) in case a P2P connection isn't possible. Pretty much just a client app is needed, the rest is done by the software. Their vision is to go beyond traditional VPN by bringing advanced NetSec (Zero Trust security model) like OpenZiti.

  > I find plenty of tutorials online for setting up the most basic Wireguard apparatus.
  > Like most peoples', my machines are stuck behind NATs. To connect between NATted hosts, you need control of a host that is not, to keep up on what external addresses the NATs are presenting.
  > The docs for WireGuard mention bounce servers, but say nothing about how to set one up.
- [WireGuard VPN Road Warrior Setup](https://emanuelduss.ch/2018/09/29/wireguard-vpn-road-warrior-setup/) - The important feature of this setup is, split tunnelling.
  > Either all traffic (default route) or only the traffic desired for the internal network can be routed through the VPN (split tunneling). This can be configured on the client.

### Videos

- [WireGuard: Next Generation Abuse-Resistant Kernel Network Tunnel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYztYCbV_8U)- A good talk from the WireGuard developer and security researcher, Jason Donenfeld explaining what WireGuard can do and how it works. The talk examine both the cryptography and kernel implementation particulars of WireGuard and explore an offensive attack perspective on network tunnels.
- [How To Build Your Own Wireguard VPN Server in The Cloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yC-gJtl9mQ) - A good tutorial from Lawerence Systems regarding WireGuard.

- [WebVM: Linux Virtualization in WebAssembly with Full Networking via Tailscale](https://leaningtech.com/webvm-virtual-machine-with-networking-via-tailscale/) - Run WireGuard and Tailscale in the browser. wireguard-go code compiled to Wasm. WebVM is proprietary WebAssembly-powered x86 virtualization tech. I'm genuinely curious how it compares to v86/Fabrice Bellard's JSLinux (like WebVM but free and opened-source).
